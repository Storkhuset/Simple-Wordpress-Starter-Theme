# Simple-Wordpress-Starter-Theme
A simple starter theme for beginner Theme developers and Graphic Designers with limited knowledge of PHP. 

Taking up WordPress Theme development might seem daunting for a Graphic Designer and most starter templates looks overly complicated at a first look. That’s why I have created this simple starter template. To use this template, the only requirements is that you know some HTML, CSS and JavaScript. All the other necessary PHP and WordPress specific functionality is already in place.


### If you are just starting out with WordPress Theme Development
If you are just starting out with Theme development, I recommend that you start with just styling the “output” given to you by default. Use the style.css file located in “accets/css/” for your custom CSS. Install the theme, add a menu, add some pages and posts and and take a look at what gets output to the front-end. I have given some elements custom CSS classes but most of the CSS classes comes from WordPress.
